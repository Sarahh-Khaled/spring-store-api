#  Store API Project
This is a robust Backend RESTful API built with **Java** and **Spring Boot 3**. I developed this project to practice building scalable APIs, following the professional standards taught by **Mosh Hamedani**.

##  Features Implemented
* **Database Management**: Configured MySQL and used Spring Data JPA for data persistence.
* **Clean Architecture**: Followed the Controller-Service-Repository pattern for organized code.
* **Secure Data Transfer**: Implemented **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to ensure sensitive information (like passwords) is never exposed in the API.
* **Entity Relationships**: Mapped complex relationships between Products, Categories, and Users.
* **Professional Workflow**: Used **Git Branching** and **Pull Requests** to manage features independently.

##  Tech Stack
* **Language**: Java 17
* **Framework**: Spring Boot 3
* **Database**: MySQL
* **Tools**: Hibernate, Lombok, Maven
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

##  Current Progress
- [x] Configure MySQL & Database Migrations
- [x] Implement Product Listing with Category ID mapping
- [x] Build User API with secure DTOs
- [ ] Implement Service Layer (In Progress...)
